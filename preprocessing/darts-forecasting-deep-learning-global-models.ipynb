I want to present a comprehensive forecasting workflow. My main focus is on exploring Neural Network models (such as LSTM, NBEATS, TCN, TFT, N-HiTS).\n","\n","My basic understanding is: such complex and flexible methods require a lot of data in order to perform well. With single, univariate timeseries, that's usually not the case, and statistical methods with more structure tend to perform better. Here however we have 1782 parallel and related timeseries - Sales data for 33 product categories in 54 stores.\n","\n","Approaches I want to experiment with:\n","\n","* **Global Models (trained on multiple timeseries)**\n","* **Hierarchical Forecasting (Forecast Reconciliation)**\n","* **Ensembling**\n","* **Combinations of all the above**\n","\n","I use the **<ins>Darts Library</ins>** for my timeseries modeling - it simplifies the workflow a lot for a beginner-level programmer like me and has implementations of all the newest Deep Learning Forecasting methods around.\n","\n","So far however, the simple Exponential Smoothing baseline proved superior to my (global) Neural Network models. Global Models based on boosted trees however perform well - so far the best. But I'm sure there is still a lot of room for optimization.\n","\n","*I spammed the leaderboard with many submissions, as I couldn't replicate my original LightGBM submission created on Google Colab - turns out I had one little error in my code here when creating the final submission file with zero forecasting. I cleaned up that error now, so everything should be reproducible."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["<a id=\"1\"></a> <br>\n","# 1.

I often found simpler statistical models outperforming them.\n","\n","Intuitively, that makes sense: Neural networks are highly complex, non-linear models that don't force any structure on the data at hand. Statistical methods like ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing or Prophet on the other hand involve a lot of fixed structure and don't offer the same amount of flexibility as neural networks or boosted tree models. But when modeling a single univariate timeseries of a couple hundred data points, we don't need all this flexbility - there is not enough signal in our data to model highly complex relationships. When it comes to capturing basic patterns like seasonality and trend, statistical methods do a great job.\n","\n","The store sales data at hand however consists of 1782 timeseries of considerable length, including a set of relevant covariates (such as holidays and product promotions). That means there should be some signal to exploit with Machine Learning models. I would expect (most of) those 1782 series to be somewhat similar/related to each other, as they all concern store sales, which should follow common patterns to some extent. So what now?\n","\n","**Global Models!** My plan is to leverage the power of NN and Boosting models to exploit/capture as much of the signal in our huge dataset as possible.

Within the Darts framework, those are called *future_covariates*. N-HiTS is similar to the N-BEATS model, but might offer computational benefits over it.

For that reason, I will only include the Tuning for this model in my notebook.\n","\n","### COMPUTATION ISSUES\n","\n","Importantly, the following models are all trained with small subsets of the full timeseries (see the parameter *max_samples_per_ts* in the code) in order to make computation feasible. The Kaggle GPU is not quick enough to deal with bigger data I think. Therefore the following models should not be regarded as optimal at all, but rather serve as minimal examples.\n","\n","CatBoost is trained with the last 365 samples (input + output lengths) of each series, N-HiTS is trained with the last 180 samples, LSTM is trained with the last 60 samples, and TFT is trained with only the last 7 samples per series.

That means, those models treat all samples as coming from the same data generating process. Whether that is a good assumption?
